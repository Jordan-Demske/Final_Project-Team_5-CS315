## Project Report

Reflection:

Our team is very happy with what we have accomplished. We wish that we had more time to continue the project together.

Once again, we showed great communication skills outside of the classroom. We spent many hours collaborating together, and everyone contributed a fair share. The lighting system was very intriguing for us, but it was very challenging to manage the layers. Lastly, we all created custom assets for the game, and we realized how time consuming asset creation is.
